# C-Control

This library now requires the use of eigen (specifically the SwerveMath component). See: http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/GettingStarted.html for install instructions.

TODO:

* Generally fix functions which don't work and add needed functions.
* Clean up spacing and make code more readable.
* Highly optimize most code -- most is called each loop iteration
