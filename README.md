# C-Control

This repo contain some basic math functions, some swerve math, and motion profiling code. This repo now requires the use of eigen (specifically the SwerveMath component). See: http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/GettingStarted.html for install instructions. Some testing code used just for motion profiling require gnuplot.


TODO:

* Generally fix functions which don't work and add needed functions.
* Clean up spacing and make code more readable.
* Highly optimize most code -- most is called each loop iteration
